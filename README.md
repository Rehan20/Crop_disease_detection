# Paddy Crop disease detection
Detection of disease of paddy crop 
Our system architecture of the project will be simple , flexible and more efficient
than others.
The model is made which can easily be implemented with less time and less space
thus there is no part of slow processing involved which will be best suitable for
mobile devices than the present system which takes time for execution.
Need of checking manually which takes time , and thus giving pesticides in time
which will help in preservation of time and timely actions could be taken to prevent
the disease further.


Pre-requisite for the users is to take the images of the diseased leaf .
First of all, we used Python Programming language to implement this whole project.
We used Anaconda- Jupyter Notebook as compilation software.
We used Sklearn library to train our model, plotting using matplotlib library , OpenCV for image processing ,CNN, Tensorflow,Numpy, Keras,Pandas, etc
We will use Gradio library to build GUI of the project  in the future.
